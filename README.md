# Rock The Full Stack

The full stack training curriculum from rockonsoft.com

## Lesson 0: The requirements:

- Hardware: A windows, Linux or Mac machine with some oomph. Most of the things you are going to do will run comfortably on an I5 with 8 Gig Ram (Should be able to run Docker)
- Install VS Code as IDE (https://code.visualstudio.com/download). VS Code is now the unbiguitis IDE for full stack developers. There are others, but this course will use VS Code to write code and debug application.
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). The engine everything else will run on.
- PostMan (https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) A great tool for exercising and exploring Web based APIâ€™s and resources.
- Git - you know, for source control. The material presented during this course are in git. If you are using git on windows, install https://git-scm.com/download/win. Follow the OS specific instructions for Mac and Linux. We will be looking in of follow up lesson at the course organization in git.
- A browser, we like Chrome (and so does most other people), but Firefox or Safari will do. You should take a hard look at yourself if you are thinking IE.
- Google Account (Will ge used to create your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resource)
- Valid Credit Card (Most of the GCP resource we will use is free, but some services needs billing enabled, and for these you will need your credit card details.) If you delete and of the resources after the lessons, they will not incur any or minimal costs (a few \$US cents)
